## Overview

This package provides the necessary infrastructure to take raw trio bam files in order to produce de novo deletion calls.

## Raw Data

The raw data used as an example in this package is available as the data package `MDTSData`. It includes: 

1. 15 simulated bam files organized in 5 trios using the software `capsim`
2. A pedigree file denoting the trio kinships and the file paths to the raw bam files
3. A bw file that includes mappability information

The code in the vignette also requires the `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19` package. Slighly processed versions of the data is included with `MDTS`.
